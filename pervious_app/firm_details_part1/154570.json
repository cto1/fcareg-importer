It does not include action taken by other enforcement agencies . Date Type of Action Enforcement Type 02/10/2008 Fines The FSA imposed a financial penalty of £28,000 on TBO for failure to establish and maintain effective systems and controls to: clearly document the explanation of the risks of transactions to clients; make and retain records that demonstrate the suitability of its advice; and ensure that its business is conducted in accordance with FSA requirements. TBO have agreed to undertake a risk-based past business review of customer files and to take remedial action where necessary. TBO breached Principle 3 (Management and Control) as the Firm: (i) inadequately supervised and monitor staff providing advice to customers; (ii) failed to record both the information provided by customers and the reasons for recommending products; (iii) had inadequate systems and controls in place in relation to trust signatures; and (iv) acting outside of its regulatory permission in one instance. TBO breached Principle 9 (Customers: relationships of trust) by failing to obtain and retain sufficient information about customers personal and financial circumstances and investment objectives. Furthermore, the suitability letters issued by TBO did not contain appropriate explanations of the risks associated with the transaction. FSMA"
