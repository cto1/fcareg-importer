Date Type of Action Enforcement Type 28/03/2012 Public censure On 12 March 2012, the FSA gave Welcome Financial Services Limited (\"Welcome\") a Final Notice about the publication of a statement publicly censuring Welcome because it engaged in market abuse as defined by section 118(7) of the Act (dissemination) and failed to comply with Principle 3 (management and control) of the FSA's Principles for Businesses.If Welcome had been a going concern with significant surplus assets, the very serious nature of the breaches would have led the FSA to impose a substantial financial penalty.Welcome, in its 2007 Annual Report, published false and misleading information because it failed to take account of \"deferments\" applied to overdue loans by Welcome. As Welcome knew, Welcome made extensive use of deferments. Welcome issued its 2007 Annual Report knowing that it contained information which would be disseminated to the market. Welcome therefore committed market abuse and failed to take reasonable steps to organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively in breach of Principle 3. FSMA"
